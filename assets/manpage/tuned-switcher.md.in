Tuned is a daemon for monitoring and adaptive tuning of system devices.

In order to use this program, a daemon must be installed on your system.

# COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

No custom command-line options available.

# APPLICATION MODES

## Available modes

This software can operate in two modes:

  * system tray icon (aka **applet**) - default and recommended mode controlled by the system tray icon;
  * GUI application (aka **widget**) - simplified mode for desktop environments without a system tray support.

## Modes auto-selection

If current desktop environment has a system tray support, an applet will be used, otherwise a widget.

This behavior can be overridden using the environment variable.

# ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS

Environment variables can be used to override some settings.

## Supported options

  * **TUNED_SWITCHER_FORCE_GUI=1** - force widget mode even if the system tray support is present.

## Forwarding options

Export the environment variable using the `export` command:

```
export TUNED_SWITCHER_FORCE_GUI=1
```

Start the application:

```
@APP_NAME@
```

# STARTUP

## Tuned startup

Enable startup of the Tuned service to automatically apply performance profile settings at system boot.

If the system supports systemd, it can be done using the `systemctl` tool:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now tuned.service
```

## Application startup

To enable program startup, the autorun settings of current desktop environment should be used.
