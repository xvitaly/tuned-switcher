# Using application

This program can operate in two modes:

  * system tray icon (aka applet) - default and recommended mode with support of all available features;
  * GUI application (aka widget) - simplified mode with some features are not available.

If current desktop environment has a system tray support, an applet will be used, otherwise a widget.
